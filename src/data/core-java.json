Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.",

Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape. The principles for creating Java programming were \"Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic\". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.",

In other words, the switch statement tests the equality of a variable against multiple values. Points to Remember 1. There can be one or N number of case values for a switch expression. 2. The case value must be of switch expression type only. The case value must be literal or constant. It doesn't allow variables. 3. The case values must be unique. In case of duplicate value, it renders compile-time error. 4. The Java switch expression must be of byte, short, int, long (with its Wrapper type), enums and string. 5. Each case statement can have a break statement which is optional. When control reaches to the break statement, it jumps the control after the switch expression. If a break statement is not found, it executes the next case. 6. The case value can have a default label which is optional.",
